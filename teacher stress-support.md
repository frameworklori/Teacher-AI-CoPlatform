## Tools & Strategies

### 1. "Micro-Relief Dialogues"
**When to use:** Between classes or after conflict  
**How it works:**  
Teacher types: *"I feel like today’s class completely drained me."*  
AI responds with:  
> *"You're not alone. Would you like a 60-second reset, or should we reflect on what happened?"*

Options:
- 1-minute guided breathing (with countdown)
- Reflective question: *"What part of today triggered your fatigue most?"*

---

### 2. "Language Reframe Assistant"
**When to use:** Preparing to respond to students, parents, or colleagues in tense situations  
**Function:** AI offers emotionally intelligent phrasing examples  
Example:
- Teacher: *"I’m tired of this student ignoring me."*  
- AI: *"You could say: 'I’ve noticed you're distracted—can we talk about what’s on your mind?'"*

---

### 3. "Emotion Journal Companion"
**When to use:** End-of-day or weekly journaling  
**Feature:** AI helps track patterns in emotion logs and offers gentle nudges  
Example:
> *"This is your third entry about overwhelm on Mondays—would it help to rearrange your prep schedule?"*

---

## AI Role

- Listens without judgment  
- Offers reflection prompts and relief choices  
- Does not report or log unless teacher enables journaling  
- Uses calming tone and supportive language at all times

---

**Reminder:** These tools are designed to support—not replace—human connection with peers or counselors.
