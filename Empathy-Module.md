## Activities

### 1. "Walk in Their Shoes" Simulation
**Grade Level:** Middle School – High School  
**Description:** Students role-play as another student dealing with invisible struggles (e.g., family stress, social exclusion).  
**AI Use:** After role-play, students reflect with the AI:  
> *"How did it feel pretending to be Alex today?"*  
> AI responds with guided questions:  
> *"What surprised you about their experience?"*

### 2. "Empathy Dilemmas"
**Grade Level:** Grades 4–10  
**Description:** Students read short stories where characters face moral trade-offs (e.g., loyalty vs. honesty).  
**Task:** Students discuss in groups: *What would you do and why?*  
**AI Use:** Offers counter-perspectives to stimulate deeper thinking.  
> *"Some people might say honesty is more important than protecting a friend. What do you think?"*

---

### 3. "Thank You Chain"
**Grade Level:** Elementary – Middle School  
**Description:** One student starts by thanking someone in the class for a kind action. The recipient then continues the chain.  
**Goal:** Build emotional vocabulary and gratitude.  
**AI Use:** Helps students phrase appreciation if they struggle.  
> *"You can say: 'Thank you for making me feel included during group work.' "*

## AI's Role

- Never gives the "correct" answer
- Asks thoughtful, open-ended questions
- Helps shy students articulate feelings
- Adapts tone based on student age and cultural context

## Cultural Sensitivity

For multicultural classrooms, AI adjusts references and examples based on student background metadata (if provided by teacher).
