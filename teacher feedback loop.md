# Teacher Feedback Loop

This module enables reflective collaboration between teachers and AI. It models how AI listens, adapts, and evolves based on teacher input—while always maintaining the teacher’s authority.

---

## Purpose
- Improve lesson planning and decision-making through AI-supported reflection
- Build trust between human and AI by documenting how feedback is used
- Ensure teacher voice remains central to all educational adaptations

---

## Workflow Example

### Input:
> **Teacher:** "My 5th-period class shuts down whenever we hit math word problems. I’ve tried examples, but they don’t engage."

---

### AI Response:
> "That sounds frustrating. Would you like to try one of these?"
> - Reframing the problem in a story-based scenario
> - Letting students write their own word problems using real life examples
> - Pairing them with peers who prefer verbal over numerical reasoning

---

### Teacher Reflection:
> "Let’s try the second one. I’ll assign a group task where they turn real-life problems into math challenges."

---

### AI Follow-Up:
> "Great choice. Would you like me to generate 3 starter scenarios for tomorrow?"
