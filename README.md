## 1. System Overview

### A. Teaching Interaction Module
- **Teacher input:** learning goals, classroom observations, individual learning challenges.
- **AI response:** adaptive lesson design, questioning strategies, task suggestions, cognitive model integration.

### B. Emotional Support Module
- **Teacher input:** stress expression, fatigue, classroom burnout.
- **AI response:** empathetic dialog, micro-stress relief suggestions, roleplay simulations (e.g. difficult students, parent conflict).

### C. Civic & Empathy Enrichment Module
- **Teacher input:** observations of egocentric, culturally insensitive, or disengaged student behavior.
- **AI response:** empathy-based activities, civic dilemma scripts, value-based group discussions.

## 3. Design Principles

- **Teacher control is central:** AI only advises; no autonomous decisions in the classroom.
- **Empathy is structural:** Students learn values and tolerance, not just test scores.
- **Cultural context matters:** The system adjusts tone and strategy based on student background (e.g. single-parent homes, first-generation immigrants, racial dynamics).
